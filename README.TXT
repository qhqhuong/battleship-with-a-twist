PROJECT TITLE: BATTLESHIP WITH A TWIST
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: A game which is for a player to try and destroy all 
of the computer opponents ships before the computer destroys all of the 
players ships placed on the playing grid.
VERSION or DATE: Final version - 21 Oct 2018
AUTHORS: Zoey Nguyen 
USER INSTRUCTIONS: The game will allow the player to place a number of 
ships onto the playing grid based on x and y coordinates entered by the 
user. The computer opponent will also do the same randomly. Each ship 
will only occupy a single coordinate, as such, two ships cannot be 
placed at the same set of coordinates. To keep things interesting, each 
ship when places is given a random number between 1 – 5 which indicates 
its overall strength. This means that the same ship has to be hit that 
many times in order for it to be destroyed. Once a ship has been 
destroyed it is taken out of play on the grid. Each hit on a ship get 
points for the player or the computer. The game ends when all the ships 
are destroyed.
